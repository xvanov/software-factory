# Story

## Title
Add GitHub Actions CI to the sacrifice repository — narrow read

## Slug
`add-github-actions-ci-to-the-sacrifice-repository-narrow-rea`

## Scope
`infra`

## Summary
Create the initial `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for the sacrifice repo with the required push/pull_request triggers, stable job names (`lint`, `typecheck`, `pytest`, `smoke`), Python 3.12 + `astral-sh/setup-uv`, advisory-only typecheck behavior, and Postgres-backed job structure for `pytest` and `smoke`. This story is limited to establishing the workflow contract and repo-visible checks; real green-on-main hardening is handled by the follow-up infra story.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists and runs on push + PR to main.
- [ ] lint, pytest, and smoke jobs pass on the current main of the sacrifice repo (verify via a real Actions run that goes green before merge).
- [ ] The smoke job boots a real backend + Postgres service and exercises the real user journey (not mocked).
- [ ] typecheck runs as advisory (warning only), not a hard failure.
- [ ] Job names are stable (lint, typecheck, pytest, smoke) so branch protection can require them.

### Testable Claims (EARS)
AC1.1: WHEN code is pushed to `main`, THE GitHub Actions workflow SHALL run `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
AC1.2: WHEN a pull request targets `main`, THE GitHub Actions workflow SHALL run `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
AC2.1: WHEN the workflow runs on the current `main` branch, THE `lint` job SHALL complete with passing status
AC2.2: WHEN the workflow runs on the current `main` branch, THE `pytest` job SHALL complete with passing status
AC2.3: WHEN the workflow runs on the current `main` branch, THE `smoke` job SHALL complete with passing status
AC2.4: WHEN the workflow is prepared for merge, THE repository SHALL have a real GitHub Actions run showing green status for `lint`, `pytest`, and `smoke`
AC3.1: WHEN the `smoke` job runs, THE job SHALL boot a real backend service
AC3.2: WHEN the `smoke` job runs, THE job SHALL boot a Postgres service
AC3.3: WHEN the `smoke` job runs, THE job SHALL exercise the real register → login → create-goal → proof user journey
AC3.4: WHEN the `smoke` job runs, THE journey execution SHALL be not mocked
AC4.1: WHEN the `typecheck` job runs, THE workflow SHALL report typecheck output as advisory only
AC4.2: WHEN the `typecheck` job encounters findings, THE workflow SHALL not fail as a hard failure because of the `typecheck` job
AC5.1: WHEN the workflow defines branch-protection-visible checks, THE job names SHALL be `lint`, `typecheck`, `pytest`, and `smoke`

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [ ] Add workflow triggers for `push` to `main`
- [ ] Add workflow triggers for `pull_request` to `main`
- [ ] Configure Python 3.12 in workflow jobs
- [ ] Configure `astral-sh/setup-uv`
- [ ] Add `lint` job with stable name `lint`
- [ ] In `lint`, run `cd backend && uv run ruff check .`
- [ ] In `lint`, run `cd backend && uv run ruff format --check .`
- [ ] Add `typecheck` job with stable name `typecheck`
- [ ] In `typecheck`, run `cd backend && uv run mypy app`
- [ ] Make `typecheck` warning-only / non-blocking
- [ ] Emit warning-visible output for `typecheck`
- [ ] Add `pytest` job with stable name `pytest`
- [ ] Attach real Postgres service to `pytest`
- [ ] In `pytest`, run `cd backend && uv run --extra dev pytest -q tests/`
- [ ] Mirror Postgres wiring from repo-local boot patterns where applicable
- [ ] Add `smoke` job with stable name `smoke`
- [ ] Attach real Postgres service to `smoke`
- [ ] In `smoke`, run `make smoke`
- [ ] Ensure `smoke` boots a real backend against Postgres
- [ ] Ensure `smoke` exercises register → login → create-goal → proof journey
- [ ] Add sensible per-job timeouts
- [ ] Keep job names exactly `lint`, `typecheck`, `pytest`, `smoke`
- [ ] Validate workflow syntax and GitHub Actions compatibility
- [ ] Capture any discovered green-run gaps for follow-up in the hardening story

## Dev Notes
### Scope constraints
- This is the narrow-read story: establish the workflow file and check contract in-repo.
- Do not broaden scope into unrelated repo cleanup.
- If current `main` does not go green immediately after workflow creation, record concrete failures for the follow-up hardening story rather than hiding them with mocks or requirement drift.

### Direction acceptance criteria (verbatim)
- [ ] `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists and runs on push + PR to main.
- [ ] lint, pytest, and smoke jobs pass on the current main of the sacrifice repo (verify via a real Actions run that goes green before merge).
- [ ] The smoke job boots a real backend + Postgres service and exercises the real user journey (not mocked).
- [ ] typecheck runs as advisory (warning only), not a hard failure.
- [ ] Job names are stable (lint, typecheck, pytest, smoke) so branch protection can require them.

### Implementation notes for Dev/Test handoff
- CI must be first-party GitHub Actions under `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; no external-only gating substitutes for this story.
- Use Python 3.12 and `astral-sh/setup-uv` exactly as directed.
- `typecheck` must remain visible but non-blocking; implement warning-only semantics without changing the required stable job name.
- `pytest` and `smoke` require real Postgres service wiring; align with existing repo boot conventions referenced by the direction (`docker-compose.yml`, `scripts/smoke.sh`, `make smoke`).
- `smoke` must exercise the real user journey; do not replace it with mocked calls or synthetic no-op checks.
- Stable job names are branch-protection contract surface; avoid matrix-generated or dynamically renamed jobs.
- The follow-up story owns iterative hardening needed to make current `main` fully green if initial Actions runs expose environment/readiness issues.
