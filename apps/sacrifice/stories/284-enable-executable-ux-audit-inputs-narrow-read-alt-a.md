# Story

## Title
Enable executable UX-audit inputs — narrow read

## Slug
`enable-executable-ux-audit-inputs-narrow-read-alt-a`

## Scope
`backend`

## Summary
Define the narrowest backend-ready contract for executable UX-audit inputs so an auditor run can consume ordered flow-step data and one observation path reference without implementing the full runtime plumbing for every downstream slice.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Verbatim direction AC: `UX auditor input includes each flow.md body or equivalent ordered steps.`
2. Verbatim direction AC: `UX auditor run can access a live browser sandbox or recorded step artifacts tied to each flow step.`

### Testable Claims (EARS)
- AC1.1: WHEN a UX-auditor run input is provided, THE input contract SHALL include each `flow.md` body or equivalent ordered steps.
- AC2.1: WHEN a UX-auditor run is executed, THE run SHALL access a live browser sandbox or recorded step artifacts tied to each flow step.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Identify current UX-auditor/backend entrypoint that receives audit-run inputs.
- [ ] Define backend input schema for ordered flow-step payloads.
- [ ] Ensure schema accepts full `flow.md` body or equivalent ordered steps.
- [ ] Define step structure needed to preserve ordering through execution.
- [ ] Define observation-path field(s) covering live browser sandbox or recorded step artifacts.
- [ ] Validate that observation-path data is tied to individual flow steps.
- [ ] Reject inputs missing ordered steps.
- [ ] Reject inputs that provide neither live sandbox access nor recorded step artifacts.
- [ ] Add/update backend tests for valid ordered-step input acceptance.
- [ ] Add/update backend tests for invalid input rejection paths.
- [ ] Add/update backend tests proving step-to-observation-path linkage is surfaced to the run.
- [ ] Keep implementation limited to contract/validation/run-consumption seam; no broad infra rewrite.

## Dev Notes
### Scope intent
Narrow read: prepare only the minimal backend contract and validation/consumption seam required to make UX-audit inputs executable. Do not expand this story into full sandbox provisioning, artifact capture generation, or canonical docs rewrites.

### flow.md
[flow.md: none provided in direction]

### api_spec.md
[api_spec.md: none provided in direction]

### Direction acceptance criteria (verbatim embed)
- [ ] UX auditor input includes each flow.md body or equivalent ordered steps.
- [ ] UX auditor run can access a live browser sandbox or recorded step artifacts tied to each flow step.

### Implementation notes for Dev/Test-Designer
- Direction provides no `flow.md`; this story must therefore make the contract capable of carrying the `flow.md` body or equivalent ordered steps supplied by future directions/runs.
- Direction provides no `api_spec.md`; backend schema/validation details must be derived from existing code seams, not from an external contract file.
- PM decomposition indicates this direction is intentionally split. Keep this story at the contract boundary that later recorded-artifact and live-browser stories can depend on.
- Because the assigned story is `backend`, Dev Notes preserve backend focus even though one PM child story separately targets `infra` and another targets `docs`.
- If current code lacks any explicit UX-auditor run entrypoint, anchor the work at the smallest existing backend seam that receives or normalizes audit inputs, and record that seam in the Dev Agent Record.
- If no current UX-auditor implementation exists, validation tests may need to prove run-consumable shape at the adapter boundary rather than a full end-to-end audit execution.
- Do not invent new product requirements beyond the two direction ACs.
