# Story

## Story
As a release verifier,
I want an executable deployed-web OAuth verification slice,
so that Google and GitHub login failures on the deployed origin are reproducible with evidence before code-path fixes are attempted.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clicking 'Sign in with Google' on the deployed web app completes OAuth and ends authenticated (token stored, user loaded, no redirect-error banner).
- [ ] Clicking 'Sign in with GitHub' on the deployed web app completes OAuth and ends authenticated.
- [ ] After the provider redirect, the web client POSTs /api/auth/exchange with the ?auth_code= from the callback URL and stores the returned access_token.
- [ ] The OAuth state/CSRF cookie set at /api/auth/<provider>/login is present and honored on the callback on the deployed origin.
- [ ] A reproducible check (e2e spec or documented manual steps) demonstrates a full sign-in against the deployed instance.

### Testable Claims (EARS)
AC1.1: WHEN a desktop-browser user clicks 'Sign in with Google' on the deployed web app, THE system SHALL complete the Google OAuth flow and end the user authenticated.
AC1.2: WHEN the Google OAuth flow completes on the deployed web app, THE web client SHALL have stored the token.
AC1.3: WHEN the Google OAuth flow completes on the deployed web app, THE web client SHALL have loaded the user.
AC1.4: WHEN the Google OAuth flow completes on the deployed web app, THE web client SHALL not show a redirect-error banner.
AC2.1: WHEN a desktop-browser user clicks 'Sign in with GitHub' on the deployed web app, THE system SHALL complete the GitHub OAuth flow and end the user authenticated.
AC3.1: WHEN the provider redirects back with ?auth_code= in the callback URL, THE web client SHALL POST /api/auth/exchange using that auth_code.
AC3.2: WHEN /api/auth/exchange returns the access_token, THE web client SHALL store the returned access_token.
AC4.1: WHEN /api/auth/<provider>/login is invoked on the deployed origin, THE system SHALL set the OAuth state/CSRF cookie.
AC4.2: WHEN the provider callback is handled on the deployed origin, THE system SHALL honor the OAuth state/CSRF cookie.
AC5.1: WHEN operators or CI need to verify deployed sign-in, THE project SHALL provide a reproducible check that demonstrates a full sign-in against the deployed instance.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Identify existing deployed-web e2e/test harness entrypoint for browser auth verification
- [ ] Add verification coverage for deployed Google login flow shape
- [ ] Add verification coverage for deployed GitHub login flow shape
- [ ] Capture callback URL observation with ?auth_code=
- [ ] Capture POST /api/auth/exchange network observation
- [ ] Capture access_token storage evidence on web client
- [ ] Capture authenticated user-loaded state evidence
- [ ] Capture redirect-error banner absence/presence evidence
- [ ] Capture state/CSRF cookie issuance evidence from /api/auth/<provider>/login
- [ ] Capture state/CSRF cookie callback-honored evidence on deployed origin
- [ ] Make failures explicit by layer: provider redirect, cookie, exchange POST, token persistence, user load
- [ ] Keep harness read-only with respect to auth hardening semantics
- [ ] Document execution prerequisites for deployed-instance verification within test asset or adjacent comments

## Dev Notes
- Scope boundary: test-only verification slice. Do not implement backend or frontend fixes in this story; produce executable evidence that localizes the failing layer on the deployed origin.
- flow.md: none
- api_spec.md: none
- Verbatim direction acceptance criteria:
  - [ ] Clicking 'Sign in with Google' on the deployed web app completes OAuth and ends authenticated (token stored, user loaded, no redirect-error banner).
  - [ ] Clicking 'Sign in with GitHub' on the deployed web app completes OAuth and ends authenticated.
  - [ ] After the provider redirect, the web client POSTs /api/auth/exchange with the ?auth_code= from the callback URL and stores the returned access_token.
  - [ ] The OAuth state/CSRF cookie set at /api/auth/<provider>/login is present and honored on the callback on the deployed origin.
  - [ ] A reproducible check (e2e spec or documented manual steps) demonstrates a full sign-in against the deployed instance.
- Direction fault domains to preserve in failure reporting: deployed app not running canonical auth_code exchange path; OAuth redirect URI mismatch for deployed origin; state/CSRF cookie not being set, persisted, or honored on callback; frontend callback handler not completing /api/auth/exchange on deployed web.
- Evidence expectations for this story: browser-level observation of callback URL, network exchange request, cookie presence, token persistence, and authenticated state.
- Keep CSRF hardening intact; verification must assert the existing auth_code + state-cookie path rather than bypass it.
