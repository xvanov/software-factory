## Acceptance criteria (verbatim from the direction — the SPEC)

1. SECURITY: symbolic link within a whitelisted path that points to the host root directory `/`, and then request a mount using the symlink path.
The `allowed_host_paths` configuration option in OpenSandbox is intended to restrict sandbox containers to a whitelist of host paths that may be mounted. However, when validating paths, `_validate_host_volume` only uses `os.path.normpath` for lexical normalization and never calls `os.path.realpath` to resolve symbolic links.

An attacker can create a symbolic link within a whitelisted path that points to the host root directory `/`, and then request a mount using the symlink path. The lexical validation passes because the path begins with the whitelisted prefix, but Docker resolves the symbolic link when performing the bind mount, so the actual mounted path can be any host path chosen by the attacker.

This vulnerability remains exploitable even when the administrator has correctly configured the `allowed_host_paths` whitelist, rendering the security mechanism completely ineffective.

# FIXES
1. Add symbolic link detection in `ensure_valid_host_path`: check whether each intermediate path component is a symbolic link, and reject any path that contains symlinks.

2. Align the security validation logic for PVC volumes: `_validate_pvc_volume` already uses `os.path.realpath(strict=True)`, and host volumes should enforce the same standard.
