1. [Bug]: Windows browser-open in DeviceCodeFlow uses shell=True with externally-supplied URL
### What happened?

`DeviceCodeFlow._try_open_browser` in `src/openharness/auth/flows.py` opens the browser on Windows by calling:

```python
subprocess.Popen(
    ["start", "", url],
    shell=True,
    stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL,
    stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL,
)
```

Because `shell=True` routes the call through `cmd.exe`, characters like `&`, `|`, and `^` inside the URL are interpreted as **command separators**, not as URL data. The `url` argument here is **externally supplied** — it is the `verification_uri` returned by the GitHub device-flow endpoint, or for users who pass `enterprise_url` to the flow, it is a value derived from a user-configured (and potentially compromised) GitHub Enterprise host.

A device-flow endpoint that returned `verification_uri` like:

```
https://github.com/login/device&calc.exe
```

…would launch `calc.exe` alongside the browser the next time a user ran `oh setup` / Copilot login on Windows.

The macOS and Linux/WSL branches in the same function correctly pass argv lists with `shell=False`, so this only affects Windows.

### Steps to reproduce

The call site is reached during any GitHub OAuth device-code login (`oh setup`, Copilot login). To demonstrate the underlying primitive on a Windows machine without a real malicious server, run:

```python
# windows-repro.py — run on Windows with `python windows-repro.py`
import subprocess

malicious_url = "https://example.com&calc.exe"
subprocess.Popen(
    ["start", "", malicious_url],
    shell=True,
)
```

This both opens the browser **and** launches Calculator. Replace `calc.exe` with `cmd /c <anything>` to demonstrate arbitrary command execution.

To trigger it through OpenHarness end-to-end you would need a GitHub Enterprise endpoint (or a man-in-the-middle on the device-flow response) that returns a poisoned `verification_uri`; the call chain is `oh auth ... -> DeviceCodeFlow.run -> request_device_code -> _try_open_browser(dc.verification_uri)`.

### Expected behavior

A URL returned by the device-flow endpoint should never be parsed as a shell command line. The Windows branch should use a launcher that does not go through `cmd.exe` — e.g. `os.startfile(url)`, which calls `ShellExecuteW` directly and hands the full URL to the registered protocol handler verbatim. Non-`http(s)` schemes should also be rejected up front so `file:` / `javascript:` / a bare executable name cannot reach the launcher.

### Environment

- File: `src/openharness/auth/flows.py:84-91`
- Affected platform: Windows (any Python)
- Reachable code paths: `oh setup` (Copilot/GitHub OAuth), any caller of `DeviceCodeFlow` with a non-default `enterprise_url`, and `BrowserFlow` (which delegates to `DeviceCodeFlow._try_open_browser`).

### Relevant logs or screenshots

n/a — the bug is in the call construction itself.

Happy to send a PR replacing the Windows branch with `os.startfile` and adding a scheme guard plus regression tests for the four platform branches.
