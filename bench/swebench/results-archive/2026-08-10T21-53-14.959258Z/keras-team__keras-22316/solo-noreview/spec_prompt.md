## Acceptance criteria (verbatim from the direction — the SPEC)

1. `Function.operations` include operations used to compute inputs
`Function` objects created with inputs that are the result of other operations include these operations in `Function.operations` even though these operations are not a part of the `Function`s computation graph.

Example

```python
import keras
from keras import Function

x = keras.Input(batch_shape=(), name="x")
y = x**2
z = y + 1
func = Function(y, z)
print(func.operations)
# [<InputLayer name=x, built=True>, <Operation name=power>, <Operation name=add>]
```

I don't believe there's any significant performance penalty in running the computation graph, but it can lead to confusing situations when crawling a `Model`s computation graph via `clone_model`. A work-around is to clone the model with fresh inputs first.

```python
from keras.models import clone_model

model = keras.Model(y, z)
print(model.operations) # same as above
model = clone_model(model, keras.Input(batch_shape=y.shape, dtype=y.dtype), lambda op: op)
print(model.operations) # [<InputLayer name=input_layer, built=True>, <Operation name=add>]
```
