## Acceptance criteria (verbatim from the direction — the SPEC)

1. communicate terminal size to pty after fit on xterm
### First Check

- [x] I added a very descriptive title here.
- [x] This is not a security issue (those should be reported via the [security advisory](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/security/advisories/new) instead).
- [x] This is not a Q&A. I am sure something is wrong with NiceGUI or its documentation.
- [x] I used the GitHub search to find a similar [issue](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/issues) and came up empty.

### Example Code

```python

```

### Description

More like a feature request than a bug.

Using the `ui.xterm` example [from this same repo](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/examples/xterm/main.py) I found that the terminal cannot correctly detect its own size:

```bash
$ python
>>> import os
>>> os.get_terminal_size()
os.terminal_size(columns=0, lines=0)
```

the docstring of the xterm component [mentions](https://github.com/zauberzeug/nicegui/blob/main/nicegui/elements/xterm/xterm.py#L41) that there is a `fit` method but it resizes the `xterm` in the client to the container, while the `pty` remains unaware of the size change.

I found that that the terminal size can be communicated by modifying the example like this:

```python

terminal = ui.xterm({"cols": 130, "rows": 40})
[...]
if pty_pid == pty.CHILD:
    os.execv(
        "/bin/bash", ("bash",)
    )  # child process of the fork gets replaced with "bash"
else:
    winsize = struct.pack("HHHH", 40, 130, 0, 0)
    fcntl.ioctl(pty_fd, termios.TIOCSWINSZ, winsize)
```
that is, first I pass 140x30 to the frontend component and then send the control codes to the terminal file itself so it is in sync.

I tested it and it works with the `os.terminal_size` function and also with a more sophisticated TUI app.

Is there a way to automate this and let the terminal always know its own size upon `fit` (and perhaps once at initialization)? I am not familiar with the internals of nicegui to do it, but it seems an useful feature to have.

### Additional Context

_No response_

## Additional acceptance criteria
- `ui.xterm()` exposes an `on_resize(handler)` API for terminal resize events.
- Resize handlers receive an event object with integer `cols` and `rows` attributes matching the fitted terminal size.
- Calling `fit()` after the terminal size changes emits the resize event with the current dimensions.
- Existing bell and data event behavior remains unchanged; resize handlers are not called unless a resize occurs.
