## Acceptance criteria (verbatim from the direction — the SPEC)

1. Suport for cloudformation AWS::KMS::Alias resource does not support Full ARN as TargetKeyId
Hi Team, 

we've recently upgraded moto from 5.1.21 to 5.1.22 (renovate) and our testing framework broke with the following error:

```
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 

self = <moto.kms.models.KmsBackend object at 0x10b3b1fd0>
target_key_id = 'arn:aws:kms:ap-southeast-2:123456789012:key/26fe9350-25da-4bac-91f8-796abadaee5e'
alias_name = 'alias/test-alias'

    def update_alias(self, target_key_id: str, alias_name: str) -> Alias:
        for key in self.keys.values():
            if alias_name in key.aliases and target_key_id != key.id:
                # Updating the Key that this is an alias of
                alias = key.aliases.pop(alias_name)
                self.keys[target_key_id].aliases[alias_name] = alias
                return alias
        # TargetKeyId hasn't changed - nothing to update
>       return self.keys[target_key_id].aliases[alias_name]
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
E       KeyError: 'arn:aws:kms:ap-southeast-2:123456789012:key/26fe9350-25da-4bac-91f8-796abadaee5e'

.venv/lib/python3.14/site-packages/moto/kms/models.py:521: KeyError
```

Upon investigation of the release notes and code, this seems related to:
- https://github.com/getmoto/moto/pull/9745
- https://github.com/getmoto/moto/issues/9724

where support for `AWS::KMS::Alias` was added to the cloudformation sub-module, which seem to only accept a KeyId and not the full ARN.

The full ARN is officially supported by AWS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/TemplateReference/aws-resource-kms-alias.html), support should probably be added to moto as well. 

For now, I'll downgrade the moto version back to 5.1.21 to pass my unit / integration tests.
