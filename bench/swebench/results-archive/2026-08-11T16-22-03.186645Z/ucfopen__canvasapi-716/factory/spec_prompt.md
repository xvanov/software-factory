## Acceptance criteria (verbatim from the direction — the SPEC)

1. `obj_or_str` improperly rejects strings
We have a utility function called `obj_or_id` that is used across the library. It is designed to allow the user to provide either the canvas ID of an resource as an `int`, or let the library find the ID from an object automatically.

We also have a function called `obj_or_str` that appears to attempt doing a similar thing, albeit with type of `str` instead of `int`. Despite looking similar, it doesn't actually respect the user passing in a `str`. While the docstring for `obj_or_str` doesn't claim to work like `obj_or_id`, it's clear from usage in other functions that we expected it to.

It looks like `obj_or_str` has limited reach - only on functions related to `canvasapi.feature.Feature` objects:

- `canvasapi.account.Account.get_feature_flag()`
- `canvasapi.course.Course.get_feature_flag()`
- `canvasapi.feature.FeatureFlag.delete()`
- `canvasapi.feature.FeatureFlag.set_feature_flag()`
- `canvasapi.user.User.get_feature_flag()`


Update `obj_or_str` to be more in line with `obj_or_id`.
