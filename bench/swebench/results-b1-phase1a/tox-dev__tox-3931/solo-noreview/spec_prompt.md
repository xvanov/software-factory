## Acceptance criteria (verbatim from the direction — the SPEC)

1. tox.toml Schema does not align with implementation for env deps property
## Issue

I am using the [Even Better TOML VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml) for a small project, which uses [the tox SchemaStore schema](https://catalog.lintel.tools/schemas/schemastore/tox/) to validate tox.toml.
The [currently-deployed schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tox-dev/tox/main/src/tox/tox.schema.json) specifies that the `env_run_base` tox.toml table property `deps` only accepts strings, but the tox CLI processes arrays of dependencies and requirements file arguments without issue, and using an array [is demonstrated in the tox documentation](https://tox.wiki/en/stable/reference/config.html#deps).
It appears tox is designed to treat this as either a string or an array, so the TOML configuration schema should reflect that.

## Environment

- OS: Any

This is not related to the tox application itself, but to the current and published schema for tox.toml

## Output of running tox

Not relevant to the bug, as this is related to the published TOML configuration schema, not the tox application.
