"""Independent acceptance-oracle authoring (WS1.2).

This module authors the acceptance test that the ``acceptance-verified`` gate
later runs. The whole point is INDEPENDENCE from the dev:

* Authored from the SPEC ONLY — the direction's acceptance criteria (+ its
  ``flow.md`` / ``api_spec.md`` if present) and the story title/scope. It is
  NEVER given the dev's implementation or the dev's tests.
* Authored EARLY — at story spawn (``handle_stories_spawned``), which runs at
  pm-sync time, long before the dev handler runs on a later tick. Freezing the
  test before the dev starts is the strongest anti-reward-hack posture: the dev
  cannot shape a test that already exists and that it never sees.
* Stored in FACTORY STATE — under ``state/acceptance/<app>/<story_id>/`` — which
  is outside the app repo and outside the per-story dev worktree (the worktree
  is a checkout of the app repo under ``state/worktrees/``; nothing copies
  factory ``state/acceptance/`` into it — see ``factory.chain.worktree``). The
  dev sandbox is handed only ``repo_path`` (the worktree) and never a pointer to
  this path, so it does not receive the acceptance test.

The authored path (relative to the factory root) is recorded on
``StoryRecord.acceptance_test_ref``.

    oracle into the merge-candidate checkout — which is the story's own dev
    worktree (``auto_merge._story_worktree`` returns the same tree
    ``handlers._writing_worktree`` hands the dev) — so a process that died between
    the copy and the unlink left the oracle where the dev could read it
    (independence gone) and where the chain's deterministic ``git add -A`` commit
    (``handlers._commit_green_dev_work``) would bake it into the PR. Since
    2026-08-05 the oracle only ever lands in a throwaway judge tree, so this sweep
    is cleanup after OLDER factory builds and interrupted runs, not part of the
    happy path. Still called before every gate run and on every worktree ensure —
    a stale copy from a previous build is a live breach, and the gate BLOCKS on
    anything this cannot remove.

    Sweeps the compiled ``__pycache__/*.pyc`` too — pytest leaves one next to the
    copy, it contains the same assertions, and ``git add -A`` stages it.

    NEVER deletes a file git TRACKS. Otherwise this sweep would itself be a
    destructive mechanism: a legitimately committed app test that happens to match
    the pattern would be removed from the checkout, and the chain's later
    ``git add -A`` would commit the deletion. A tracked match is logged instead —
    it cannot be a leak (a leak is untracked by construction, and the git exclude
    the gate installs keeps it that way).

    When git CANNOT ANSWER which paths are tracked (git missing from PATH, not a
    repository, a transient OSError) the sweep DELETES NOTHING and returns an
    empty list. The old behaviour was to treat "unknowable" as "nothing is
    tracked" and delete every match, which destroyed git-tracked app files —
    a destructive fail direction in a function whose docstring promises the
    opposite. Refusing is fail-safe in both directions: nothing is destroyed, and
    the caller that cares about a leak (``gates.acceptance_verified``) checks with
    :func:`unremovable_oracle_leaks` afterwards and BLOCKS on anything left behind
    that is genuinely a leak.

    error — an expensive FALSE BLOCK (the gate is required, so the story is
    re-dispatched to dev with an identical failure signature until it exhausts its
    retries; observed on stories 148/157 for the analogous env bug). Validating
    here makes a bad response a FAILED AUTHOR ATTEMPT that gets retried, which is
    the cheap and correct place to catch it.

    Checks: non-empty, parses as python, and declares at least one ``test_*``
    function (module-level or in a class). Deliberately does NOT require an
    ``assert``: the persona is allowed to ``pytest.skip`` a criterion that is
    untestable as written, and a wholly-vacuous oracle is caught authoritatively at
    gate time (a run in which nothing passed cannot satisfy the gate).

    ``http_mode=True`` (the app has a boot recipe, 019 AC3) additionally runs
    the out-of-process runner's own static import allowlist
    (``oracle_run.oracle_import_check``) — an author response that regresses to
    the legacy import-form shape (``from app.mod import x``) is a FAILED
    AUTHOR ATTEMPT, retried the same as a syntax error, rather than a stored
    blocker discovered only when ``acceptance-verified`` runs it.
