"""Boot a real instance of the app on an ephemeral port (019 AC3).

The out-of-process oracle drives a BOOTED app over HTTP instead of importing
its code, so the interpreter that computes the verdict never runs a single
line the diff wrote. This module owns the one place that is allowed to start
and stop that process: port allocation, health polling, environment
construction, and — the part that must never be gotten wrong — teardown.

Teardown is by PROCESS GROUP, never ``pkill -f``: a boot command like
``uv run uvicorn app.main:app`` commonly forks or execs a grandchild (uv execs
uvicorn; uvicorn with a reloader forks a worker), and killing only the direct
child leaves the grandchild running and the port held. ``start_new_session``
makes the child its own process-group leader, so ``os.killpg`` reaches the
whole tree with one signal — SIGTERM first, a grace period, then SIGKILL. A
module-level registry plus an ``atexit`` reaper is the belt-and-braces: if the
gate process itself is killed before a ``finally`` runs, nothing here can
clean up, but the registry at least documents what was live so the next
process to touch this app knows to look.

Substitution of ``{port}`` / ``{base_url}`` / ``{run_id}`` / ``{run_dir}`` in
the boot command and env values is a LITERAL replace, never ``str.format``: a
real boot command can contain other braces (a compose env-var expansion, a jq
filter) and ``str.format`` raising ``KeyError`` on one would abort the whole
merge evaluation rather than failing this one gate.
