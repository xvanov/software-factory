"""Detector -> direction trigger, deduped on signature (019 AC7 / Flow D).

The FMS L1 Watcher — deleted 2026-08-07 with the other three LLM tiers (see
``STATUS.md`` and the Exteroception v1 direction, P0) — was the *only*
production caller of ``factory.manager.detectors.DETECTORS``. This module is
their replacement caller: a plain chain-tick pass, no LLM in the loop, that
turns a detector firing into a machine-filed direction and stops the same
fault from being re-filed every tick (the "33x-re-file class" — the manager's
own measured 78% proposal redundancy).

Design, top to bottom
----------------------
1. **Adapters, not raw calls.** Each of the 11 registered detectors returns a
   different shape (a list of findings, or a metrics dict) and most of them
   describe the *whole app pipeline*, not the one app this tick happens to be
   driving. ``_ADAPTERS`` maps detector name -> a small function that (a)
   invokes the detector with this tick's ``since``/lookback, (b) filters its
   output down to the rows that belong to ``app`` (a story-id -> app lookup
   via ``state/factory.db`` where the detector itself has no ``app`` field),
   and (c) reduces each surviving row to a *firing*: ``(subject, evidence)``,
   where ``subject`` is a STABLE entity name (a story id, a
   ``(story, persona)`` pair, a path, a state-transition triple) — never a
   timestamp or free text, because the subject feeds the dedupe signature.

   Every adapter call is individually wrapped and its RETURN SHAPE is
   validated: a crashing detector, or one that returns something other than
   ``list[Firing]``, records an error and every OTHER detector still runs.
   ``_ADAPTERS`` is asserted (in tests) to cover exactly ``set(DETECTORS)`` —
   the failure this prevents is the deleted watcher's own: it hard-coded 9 of
   11 detectors and silently never called the other 2.

2. **Signature + dedupe.** ``f"{detector}:{normalize(subject)}"`` is embedded
   verbatim as ``<!-- detector-signature: {sig} -->`` in the filed direction's
   body (the ``ci_health`` pattern — see ``factory.chain.ci_health``).
   ``normalize`` maps internal whitespace to ``_`` (never a literal space —
   the marker-scan regex's capture group deliberately excludes whitespace, so
   a space inside a signature would make the marker permanently unreadable
   and re-file every tick forever; review round 2, S4). Before filing, this
   module scans the app's non-terminal directions for that marker. Unlike
   ``ci_health``, a scan FAILURE here refuses to file rather than falling
   through to "not open" — ``ci_health`` gates exactly one signature per app,
   so failing open there costs at most one duplicate; this module fans out
   across 11 detectors, and failing open on a broken scan is precisely the
   re-file storm this whole mechanism exists to prevent. Fail SAFE means
   blocking new filings, never re-filing on a dedupe blind spot. A direction
   directory with no readable ``direction.md`` (e.g. a partial write left
   behind by a disk-full ``create_direction`` call) makes the whole scan
   untrustworthy and is treated the same way (S3).

   Dedupe-terminal policy (S9): a direction status of ``closed`` is ALSO
   terminal for this scan (a superset of the shared
   ``factory.chain.scheduled_tasks._TERMINAL_DIRECTION_STATUSES``, kept LOCAL
   to this module rather than edited into that shared constant — see the
   docstring on ``_open_detector_signatures``). Once an operator explicitly
   closes a detector-filed direction, its signature is free to fire again:
   ``factory/manager/gc.py`` only reaps ``scheduled-`` sources, so a
   ``detector-*`` direction is never garbage-collected, and treating
   ``closed`` as non-terminal-forever would mean the ONLY way out of the
   inbox is permanent silence. This is safe only combined with the S1
   liveness/recency fix below — without it, a still-firing-on-stale-evidence
   direction that gets closed would immediately re-file (the exact
   abandoned<->refile ping-pong the first review round measured).

3. **A hard cap, priority-ordered.** At most ``_MAX_FILINGS_PER_TICK`` (3) new
   directions per tick, across every detector combined — CLAUDE.md's
   "nothing loops more than 3 times" applied to self-filed work. Firings
   beyond the cap are reported, not dropped: dedupe means they file on a
   LATER tick once the cap has headroom. Firings are round-robined across
   detectors by ``_DETECTOR_PRIORITY`` before the cap is applied (S7) — a
   detector with no floor (formerly ``runs_failed_since``) enumerating first
   and ALWAYS having something to report must never be able to monopolize
   the cap and starve a wedge-detecting signal like ``stalled_stories``
   indefinitely (measured: 4 consecutive ticks filed nothing else).

4. **Operator-gated filing.** Every filed direction carries
   ``source=f"detector-{name}"``. That source is not in
   ``factory.directions.approval._DETERMINISTIC_SOURCES`` (unlike
   ``ci-health``, which fires on an objective external fact — a required
   check went red), so ``requires_operator_approval`` parks every detector
   filing until ``factory approve-direction`` — spend on self-improvement
   stays operator-ratified (Flow D step 4).

5. **A built-in, category-shaped acceptance criterion (S5).** Every filed
   direction sets ``explore=True`` (S2) — the built-in criteria below ARE the
   spec, but ``factory.backpressure.validator.validate_direction``'s
   sufficiency check (``has_flow or has_api_spec or explore_tag``) never
   inspects criteria quality at all, so ``explore=False`` measured
   ``is_valid=False, severity=blocking`` for every real filing (no
   user_flow, no api_spec) and, end to end, ``pm_sync`` parked every one at
   ``needs-direction`` even after a real operator approval —
   detect-without-remediate at full filing volume. ``ci_health.py`` sets
   ``explore=True`` for exactly this shape of direction; the vacuity gate is
   the ONLY thing ``explore=True`` bypasses, and it still runs (see below).

   The criterion wording is DETECTOR-SHAPE-SPECIFIC, not one template,
   because a single "the detector goes quiet for N ticks" template is
   auto-satisfied by construction for the ``since``-windowed detectors:
   ``_mark_ran`` advances the per-app marker every tick regardless of
   outcome, so old evidence has already scrolled out of the window on the
   very next look, with nothing fixed. Three shapes:

   * **event-shaped** (``retry_storm``, ``placeholder_prompts``,
     ``conformance_breach``, ``tick_duration_outliers``, the inert
     ``runs_failed_since``): the evidence is a specific PAST event, so the
     criterion is anchored to a fixed point in time (the filing moment) —
     "no NEW finding with a timestamp after `fired_at`" — which a later scan
     merely advancing past the old evidence cannot satisfy.
   * **liveness-shaped** (``review_churn``, ``state_distribution_skew``,
     ``stalled_stories``, ``worktree_orphans``): the evidence describes an
     ONGOING condition on a still-live subject; the criterion is "the subject
     reaches a state where the detector no longer classifies it as
     live/anomalous" — satisfiable by actually fixing/advancing the subject,
     not by inaction, because the S1 liveness fix (below) means the detector
     keeps firing on unfixed, still-live evidence across repeated ticks.
   * **metric-shaped** (``cost_spike``, ``fms_yield``): the evidence is a
     factory-wide RATE; the criterion is "the rate returns to baseline".

   ``tests/test_detector_watch.py`` asserts the exact generated text
   classifies ``positive-observable`` against the real vacuity gate, that a
   real filed direction passes ``validate_direction`` (the check that would
   have caught S2), and that the liveness-shaped criterion is NOT
   auto-satisfied by calling the pass twice against unfixed state.

6. **Liveness + recency scoping (S1).** ``review_churn`` deliberately ignores
   its ``since`` argument for the cumulative cycle counts (see that
   detector's own docstring) and ``state_distribution_skew`` computes its
   skew fraction over EVERY state including ``deployed`` — a fully-shipped
   backlog reads as "74% skewed toward deployed". Against live state, this
   filed 46 directions: 44 ``review_churn`` firings on stories that had
   already shipped weeks ago, plus one ``state_distribution_skew`` firing per
   app for the same reason. Both adapters now require: (a) the subject is
   CURRENTLY live (``review_churn``'s ``active_in_window`` computed against a
   fixed ``_LIVENESS_LOOKBACK`` from *now* — deliberately NOT the pass-to-pass
   marker, which would let two consecutive ticks with nothing fixed flip a
   still-current signal to "not live" purely because the marker advanced),
   and (b) the story/skew is computed over NON-TERMINAL states only.

      "closed" would be the only way out of the inbox and it would mean
      "silenced forever". Safe only combined with the S1 liveness fix — see

      directory with NO ``direction.md`` at all (e.g. a partial write left

      round's cleanup fix, or any other cause) makes the WHOLE scan
