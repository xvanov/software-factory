"""Gate: ``acceptance-verified`` — 019 AC2 (gutted-implementation control) +
AC3 (out-of-process verdict).

The problem this closes
========================

Loop-4 makes the dev author AND run its own tests, so a coder that writes the
tests judging it can reward-hack. This gate is the INDEPENDENT layer: it runs
an acceptance test authored from the direction's acceptance criteria — the SPEC
ONLY, blind to the dev's code and tests (``factory.chain.acceptance``) — and
until 2026-08-07 it did so by having ``pytest`` IMPORT the diff's production
code and run in the SAME interpreter that computed the verdict. That carried a
forgery hole no file-level rollback could close: three lines of production
code reassigning ``pytest``'s own test-runner machinery forged a genuine-
looking red-at-base -> green-at-HEAD
(``tests/test_acceptance_oracle_green_means_something.py``, formerly an
``xfail(strict=True)``; it now hard-passes).

**THE FIX (019 AC3): the verdict is computed by a SEPARATE process driving a
BOOTED instance of the app over HTTP** — the ``smoke_green`` pattern
(``factory.chain.boot`` + ``factory.chain.oracle_run``). The oracle process
never imports a single line the diff wrote; its only channel to the app under
test is the network. Reassigning ``pytest`` internals inside the booted app's
own process cannot forge a verdict computed in a DIFFERENT process.

**THE OTHER HALF (019 AC2): the gutted-implementation control.** Booting a
real instance closes the in-process forgery, but it does not by itself stop a
criterion set that only asserts status codes and absences (the vacuity class,
Beer et al. 2001) — a fixed no-op ``200 {}`` responder would satisfy such a
criterion just as well as a correct implementation. So before crediting
anything, the SAME oracle also runs against a catch-all stub
(``factory.chain.stub_server``) that answers every request with ``200 {}``.
Only a criterion that PASSES at HEAD and FAILS (or errors) against the stub is
credited (the set ``K``); a criterion set where nothing survives that
exclusion is ``vacuous_oracle`` and blocks BEFORE a single real boot is paid
for.

Run order is cheapest evidence first: **stub → prerequisite check → HEAD boot →
BASE boot → ablation**. A bad oracle never pays for a boot; a missing
dependency (a DB container down) never pays for two.

Crediting algebra (``red_green.verdict_over``)
===============================================
Let ``K = {c : HEAD[c] == PASS and STUB[c] in {FAIL, ERROR}}``. ``K`` empty ⇒
``vacuous_oracle``. Otherwise the merge-base run is graded OVER ``K`` ONLY:
at least one ``FAIL`` in ``K`` at the base ⇒ ``red`` **candidate**; every
member of ``K`` already ``PASS`` at the base ⇒ ``green`` ⇒
``oracle_not_discriminating``; anything else (``ERROR``/``SKIP``/``MISSING``
only, or the base never booted) ⇒ ``unknown`` ⇒ fall through to the ablation
fallback (``mutation.check_can_fail``, driven here through ``oracle_probe.py``
so the ablation's OWN check is also computed out of process). An ``ERROR`` at
the base is deliberately NOT counted as red — the same reason
``red_green.base_verdict`` excludes it: a criterion that could not even be
OBSERVED is not evidence that its assertion discriminates anything.

A ``red`` candidate is credited as ``red`` only if CORROBORATED (KNOWN OPEN #1,
closed 2026-08-07/08, ``_base_run``): either some criterion in ``K`` already
PASSED at the base, or a direct, factory-issued probe against the live base
instance (``boot.probe_paths``/``served_a_real_route``) got back something
other than a 5xx. An uncorroborated all-FAIL-over-``K`` base — every credited
criterion failing for a reason that could equally be "the app never really
came up" — downgrades to ``unknown`` and falls through to the same ablation
fallback, instead of being credited on a base that was never shown to be
doing anything but failing.

What "blocking" keys off
=========================
Required-ness is a property of the APP (``gates.acceptance_oracle``), not a
DB flag; per-story applicability is re-derived from the spec
(``acceptance.acceptance_expected_for_story``). Resolution:

* Not opted in: PASS (skip). Opted in, no ACs: PASS (not applicable).
* Expectation unresolvable, or the stored oracle missing/unreadable: BLOCK
  authoritatively (self-heals via ``acceptance.reauthor_missing_oracles``).
* Dry-run / no checkout: BLOCK non-authoritatively (cannot verify).
* Cannot-run states (no boot recipe configured, the oracle statically imports
  app code, the factory's own httpx/pytest are unavailable, a prerequisite
  like a DB container is down, the stub or the runner itself is unreadable):
  BLOCK non-authoritatively and NEVER WAIVABLE — these are the gate's own
  fault or an operator config gap, and a human waving them through would ship
  something nobody verified.
* HEAD run fails an assertion, is vacuous, or every credited criterion already
  passes at the base: BLOCK authoritatively (or ``oracle_not_discriminating``,
  waivable — the oracle itself is the problem, not necessarily the dev).
* HEAD run is errors-only AND the booted app did not stay alive/healthy:
  ``app_crashed_during_run`` — non-authoritative, waivable (we cannot tell a
  wrong implementation from an app that crashed under the oracle's load).
* Credited, red at base (or failability proven by ablation), green at HEAD:
  PASS, ``authoritative=True``, ``verified=True``.
* Any infrastructure error inside this gate: AUTHORITATIVE BLOCK (the
  ``evaluate()`` wrapper below).

Waivable: ``no_merge_base``, ``base_equals_head``, ``diff_unreadable``,
``no_judge_tree``, ``channel_restore_failed``, ``oracle_not_discriminating``,
``failability_unverified``, ``head_boot_failed``, ``app_crashed_during_run``,
``oracle_run_unreadable``, ``vacuous_oracle``, ``oracle_timeout``.
NEVER waivable: the provenance pair, ``conflicting_summaries``,
``oracle_runner_unconfigured``, ``oracle_imports_app_code``,
``environment_unavailable``.

What still applies, and why (belt-and-braces, not load-bearing any more)
=========================================================================
The judge-tree provenance checks, the collection-channel rollback, and the
``pyproject.toml`` pytest/dependency split (``red_green.rollback_pytest_config_
only``) all predate this gate's in-process history, when they closed real
forced-pass attacks against a pytest run inside the dev's own collection
config. Under the out-of-process runner NONE of that machinery grades
anything any more — the oracle never touches the app's test tree at all, it
only drives a booted server over HTTP — so a hostile ``conftest.py`` has
nothing left to attach to. It stays anyway, for two reasons: (1) the ablation
fallback's scratch clone boots a MUTATED copy of the SAME tree, and a manifest
whose dependencies were reverted to the base would silently break that boot
for any story that adds a dependency — the split still matters there; (2) it
is cheap, already tested, and removing it buys nothing but a chance to get it
wrong on a rewrite. Read it as defence in depth for the ablation clone, not as
protection for the primary HTTP path.

KNOWN OPEN (2026-08-07, #1 closed 2026-08-07/08) — ranked, read before the
AC4 supervised flip
======================================================================
An adversarial review reproduced two forgeries against the first cut of this
gate (a HEAD-planted ``conftest.py`` in the oracle's own run dir, and an
in-place overwrite of the oracle file) — both closed below by
``oracle_run``'s post-run tamper check + ``--noconftest``. Of the four risks
that remained open, #1 is now closed; #2-#4 still have a v1.1 candidate:

1. **CLOSED 2026-08-07/08 — a healthy-but-semantically-broken BASE forging
   red.** ``boot._poll_health`` used to return healthy on the FIRST response
   ``< 400`` — a health endpoint that answers before its OWN dependency (a DB
   pool) is ready made the base respond 500 to EVERYTHING while still passing
   the poll; every credited criterion then failed at base (all-FAIL over
   ``K``) ⇒ ``red`` ⇒ CREDIT, cached in ``base_runs.json``. Two independent
   mechanisms now close this: (a) ``boot._poll_health`` requires
   ``_HEALTH_CONSECUTIVE_REQUIRED`` (2) BACK-TO-BACK healthy polls, reset to
   zero by any non-2xx/3xx response, hardening against a flaky boot; (b) the
   real fix, in ``_base_run``: an all-FAIL-over-``K`` base is no longer
   trusted as ``red`` on its own — it must be independently corroborated,
   either by at least one credited criterion having already PASSED at base,
   or by ``boot.probe_paths``/``served_a_real_route`` finding the LIVE base
   instance answered at least one direct, factory-issued request (built from
   the "METHOD /path" samples the required stub run already observed — no
   app-route knowledge is assumed, and the oracle's own internals are never
   parsed) with anything other than a 5xx. Failing that corroboration
   downgrades the candidate ``red`` to ``unknown`` — which falls through to
   the ablation route, is never cached (``cache_put`` already only persists
   ``red``/``green``), and can still credit the story if the ablation
   independently proves failability. See ``tests/oracle_boot_fixture.py``'s
   ``broken_at_base`` mode and the regression tests in
   ``tests/test_acceptance_oracle_green_means_something.py`` (search
   "KNOWN_OPEN_1"). Residual: the probe is a BLIND replay (no body, no auth) —
   a body-validating route may 4xx instead of exercising its real logic, so a
   4xx is accepted as "served for real" even though it proves less than a
   2xx would; this is a deliberate, stated fail-safe trade-off (a non-5xx is
   still evidence the route ran past whatever wraps the broken dependency in
   a blanket 500), not a claim that the corroboration is airtight.
2. **Shared-DB cross-run contamination — the HEAD/BASE half is closed
   (2026-08-09); two residuals remain.** The worst case was not the
   hardcoded identifier the first writeup described: the run id itself was
   ``head-{sid}``/``base-{sid}``, deterministic per story, so a CORRECTLY
   namespaced oracle collided with its own previous evaluation's rows (every
   new dev commit re-evaluates gates at the new head_sha) — observed as
   story 179's ``accept_head-179_*`` users left in the shared dev Postgres.
   ``_evaluate`` now appends a per-evaluation nonce, making
   ``ACCEPTANCE_RUN_ID`` genuinely unique for the HEAD and BASE runs, as the
   authoring prompt has always promised. RESIDUALS, still open:
   (a) the ABLATION route (``_ablation_can_fail``) is untouched — its run id
   is ``ablation-{head_ref[:12]}`` and, worse, ``mutation.check_can_fail``
   runs its green baseline and every mutant with the IDENTICAL command
   string, so an oracle that creates namespaced rows self-collides between
   baseline and mutant. Mostly fail-safe (the mutant reds before reaching
   the mutation → ``skipped`` → not proven → block), with one narrow
   fail-open: a mutation whose raise is swallowed still "kills" via the
   collision 409. Noncifying it needs a per-invocation nonce minted inside
   ``oracle_probe`` AND an ablation cache key that stops hashing the command
   string — deferred, not forgotten; the base-red route (the normal path)
   does not use it. (b) an oracle that ignores the run id and hardcodes an
   identifier still collides; enforcing "must reference ACCEPTANCE_RUN_ID"
   statically would false-block oracles that create nothing (story 172's
   reads it never). Also note: the nonce converts a loud self-collision into
   silent growth of ``accept_*`` rows in the shared dev Postgres — nothing
   reaps them today; ``run_ids.json`` next to the run caches records every
   id that ACTUALLY executed (gate ``details`` survive only on the fail
   path), preserving the mapping from row to evaluation. Do NOT "fix" any
   of this by running the HEAD oracle twice
   and requiring both green — before the nonce, that false-blocked the
   persona-sanctioned namespacing pattern by construction.
3. **Non-2xx-status criteria are credited too EASILY (docstring corrected
   2026-08-09 — the previous text had this backwards).** Both stub variants
   answer 200, so a bare ``assert status == 401`` FAILS the stub and is
   CREDITED into ``K`` (verified on story 179's ``stub_runs.json``: its ac3
   fails both variants), not excluded. The real risk is therefore mirror-
   image: a broken app that 401s/404s EVERYTHING satisfies such a criterion,
   so it discriminates less than its credit implies. Measured 2026-08-09 on
   the authored oracles then under ``state/acceptance/sacrifice/`` (runtime
   state, not reproducible from the repo): of 20 non-skipped criteria,
   exactly 1 was a pure status-only criterion, and it PASSED at base,
   contributing nothing to the verdict — immaterial that day. v1.1 if it
   ever matters: a third stub variant
   answering a plausible non-2xx (costs a STUB_VERSION bump, invalidates
   every cached stub run, and strictly raises the block rate).
4. **Behavioural mimicry.** Nothing here defends against production code that
   inspects its OWN request patterns (rate, path enumeration order, timing)
   to distinguish "being graded" from real traffic and behaves correctly only
   under grading. Not evidenced, not defended against, structurally hard to
   rule out for ANY black-box oracle.

Compositional note (F4×ablation; distinct from the closed #1 above — this is
the base failing to BOOT AT ALL, not booting healthy-but-broken): a HEAD that
exhausts a shared resource can make ``base`` fail to boot at all, steering
the gate onto the K-BLIND-if-unfixed ablation route instead of the stronger
base-red route — the ablation probe's ``--credit`` awareness
(``oracle_probe.py``) is what defangs that steering, not a coincidence:
whichever route the gate ends up on, only a FAIL on a criterion in ``K`` can
license a credit. The closed #1's downgrade-to-``unknown`` composes the same
way: it lands on the exact same K-aware ablation route, not a weaker one.

⚠ ISOLATION BOUNDARY, STATED PLAINLY: everything in this module assumes the
booted app and the oracle process share a MACHINE and a UNIX USER. That is a
PROCESS boundary, not a PRIVILEGE boundary — a same-user attacker can always
list ``/tmp``. ``oracle_run._tamper_check`` makes a same-user attack
SELF-DEFEATING (detected, blocked, authoritative), not impossible. A
different uid or a container per boot removes the assumption entirely and is
the real v1.1 closure; nothing here should be read as claiming that boundary
already exists.

    app: story 179's own ``base_runs.json`` recorded a 401 for a route that
    did not exist at base, because a parameterised route's
    ``Depends(get_current_user)`` fires before a 404 can be produced — "feature
    absent" presents as 401/403 on most of this app's routes, and a 404 is the
    exception (module docstring, KNOWN OPEN #3). Any blocking taxonomy built
    on status codes is therefore a false-block GENERATOR on this app, which is
    why this function does not look at a status code anywhere and never
    changes ``credited``, ``verdict``, or the gate's PASS/BLOCK decision — it
    only feeds ``details`` for a human (or Workstream B's later analysis) to

    authored oracle re-derives its own ``K`` against the same cached base
    result. The FINAL verdict is recomputed fresh every time from that map.

    KNOWN OPEN #1 (closed 2026-08-07/08): a base whose health endpoint answers
    before its own dependency is ready responds 500 to every REAL route while
    still passing ``_poll_health`` — every credited criterion then FAILS at
    base for a reason that has nothing to do with the diff, and the old logic
    read that as a genuine ``red`` (crediting the story on a base that was
    never actually exercised). The invariant this closes: **a ``red`` verdict
    at the base must be evidence the app ran and disagreed, not evidence that
    the app was broken.** ``verdict_over``'s raw verdict is now a CANDIDATE,
    not the answer — an all-FAIL-over-``K`` base is trusted as ``red`` only

    ALREADY PASSED at base (itself proof the app served that route for real),

    answered at least one direct, factory-issued request with something other
    than a 5xx. Neither holding downgrades the candidate ``red`` to
    ``unknown`` — which falls through to the ablation fallback, same as any
    other ``unknown`` — rather than crediting a base that was never shown to
    be doing anything but failing to boot correctly.
