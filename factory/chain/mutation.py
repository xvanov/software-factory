"""Diff-scoped mutation scoring — a MEASUREMENT, deliberately not a merge gate.

What this answers
=================
"Do the tests in this diff actually catch a change to the code in this diff?"
For each symbol the diff *touched*, replace its body with a raise, re-run the
suite, and see whether the suite notices. Suite goes red ⇒ the mutant is
**killed** (the tests exercise and assert on the symbol). Suite stays green ⇒
the mutant **survived** (the "coverage" is illusory). The score is
``killed / (killed + survived)``.

Why it lives here and not in a gate
===================================
This code is the rewrite of the ablation branch that used to live inside the
REQUIRED ``tests-meaningful`` merge gate (``gates/tests_meaningful.py``), behind
``gates.mutation_testing``. That flag was the only thing between four defects
and every merge in the factory:

1. it ablated symbols the diff never touched (whole-file symbol enumeration,
   capped at 5, sorted by path — i.e. the top five of the alphabetically-first
   changed file);
2. it was fail-OPEN — a 600 s timeout, a missing command or an already-red
   suite all produced "suite did not stay green", which it read as
   "exercised → good", with no green baseline to rule any of that out;
3. it mutated the live ``state/worktrees/`` checkout the chain pushes from, via
   a whole-file ``ast.unparse`` round-trip (comments stripped), restoring in a
   ``finally`` that a SIGKILL does not run;
4. it returned ``passed=False`` in dry-run, which is the default.

The branch was deleted rather than re-wired: an advisory branch inside a
required gate is still one edit away from blocking merges, and there is no
measured case for gating on this number yet. Nothing in ``factory/chain/gates/``
imports this module, so **no merge decision can reach this code**. That
structural fact — not a boolean — is what keeps it advisory. See
``factory mutation-score`` for the operator entry point.

How each defect is fixed here
=============================
* **Diff-scoped selection** (``select_symbols``): ``git diff -U0 base...head``
  hunks are mapped to the functions/methods whose source span contains them.
  Production-vs-test classification is delegated to ``factory.diff_paths`` —
  the one shared classifier — never re-defined here.
* **Green baseline** (``measure``): the suite must be GREEN in the throwaway
  tree before anything is mutated. Not green ⇒ ``skipped_baseline_red`` /
  ``skipped_baseline_infra``, with the output tail recorded. There is no path
  from a non-green baseline to a score.
* **Tri-state runs** (``_run_suite``): green / red / infra are distinct. Infra
  (timeout, command-not-found, pytest exit 2-5) is never read as "exercised".
* **Kill attribution**: the injected body touches a per-symbol sentinel file
  before raising, so "red" only counts as a kill when the mutation demonstrably
  ran. A red we cannot attribute to the mutation (a flake, an unrelated
  failure) is recorded as skipped, never as a kill.
* **Throwaway tree** (``_materialize_tree``): a ``git clone --local`` of the
  repo checked out at the graded SHA. The source checkout is never written to;
  correctness does not depend on the cleanup ``finally`` running, because the
  only thing the ``finally`` deletes is scratch. Stale trees from a killed
  process are reaped by age on the next run.
* **Mutation is a line splice**, not an ``ast.unparse`` round-trip: every byte
  outside the target body — comments included — survives.

Two defences the FIRST REAL RUN of this tool made necessary
==========================================================
Measuring the factory on its own diff found a way for the whole thing to be
green and meaningless, which the toy fixtures could not surface:

* **The caller's virtualenv leaked into the scratch tree.** ``uv run pytest -q``
  in a fresh clone installs only base dependencies (``pytest`` is a dev EXTRA),
  so ``uv`` resolved ``pytest`` from ``PATH`` — the calling process's venv — and
  ran that interpreter, whose editable install points at the CALLER's source.
  The mutation would have been invisible and every mutant would have "survived".
  ``_mutant_env`` now makes the caller's venv unreachable, so a command that
  cannot find its runner reports ``skipped`` instead.
* **A surviving mutant is ambiguous.** "The tests never assert on this" and "the
  suite is not importing the tree we mutated" both look like a green mutant.
  ``_provenance_probe`` breaks the file's syntax and re-runs: a suite that stays
  green is not reading the file, and every ``survived`` verdict for that file is
  withdrawn. It only runs where nothing was killed — a kill already proves it.

Cost and the cache
==================
One suite run per symbol plus one baseline. The factory's own suite is ~5m36s
warm, so five symbols is ~34 min uncached. Results are therefore cached per
``(head_sha, symbol)`` under ``state/mutation/<app>/<head_sha>.json``: a
re-measurement of the same SHA does no work and materializes no tree. A
wall-clock budget stops a run early rather than blocking for an hour, and
because the cache is per-symbol the next run resumes where it stopped.

    ``uv`` then resolved the ``pytest`` executable from ``PATH`` — finding the
    calling process's venv — and ran
    ``<caller>/.venv/bin/python <caller>/.venv/bin/pytest`` with cwd inside the
    scratch tree. That interpreter's editable install points at the CALLER's
    source, so the mutation would have been invisible: every mutant survives and
    the tool reports "your tests exercise nothing" having measured nothing.

    So the caller's venv is stripped out (``VIRTUAL_ENV``, ``PYTHONPATH``,
    ``PYTHONHOME``, ``UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT``, and any venv ``bin`` on ``PATH``
    that is not inside the scratch tree). A test command that then cannot find
    its runner fails as INFRA — which reports ``skipped``, the honest answer —
    instead of silently measuring the wrong tree. ``uv``'s own directory is put
    back afterwards so an app whose command starts with ``uv`` still resolves it.

    A surviving mutant is ambiguous: either the tests never assert on the

    outer virtualenv, a stale installed copy of the package, a monorepo test
    command rooted in a different directory). Both produce "green with the body
    gutted", and only one of them is a finding about the tests.

    The probe removes the ambiguity without needing to know anything about the
    project: make the file syntactically INVALID and re-run. Any suite that
    imports it must now fail. If it stays green, the file is not in the suite's
    import path and nothing about it was measured.

    A KILLED mutant already proves provenance, so this only runs for a file
    where nothing was killed — the exact case where the score would otherwise be
    an unfalsifiable zero.

    optimistic: a suite that flakes red on a run where the mutant WAS invoked is
    scored as a kill. The green baseline immediately before, in the same tree,

    a merge, because nothing on the merge path reads this.
