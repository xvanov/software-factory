"""Run the acceptance oracle OUT OF PROCESS, over HTTP (019 AC3).

Two jobs, and both exist because the oracle's own process must never be the
thing computing the verdict about the diff's code:

1. :func:`oracle_import_check` — a STATIC, pre-run check that the stored oracle
   source imports only the standard library, ``httpx``, and ``pytest``. A
   legacy import-form oracle (``from app.mod import normalize_email``) is
   rejected here, before a single boot is paid for — the whole reason this
   subsystem exists is that importing the diff's code puts it in the
   interpreter that grades it, which is exactly what a hostile diff can
   subvert (``_pytest.python.Function.runtest = lambda self: None``, the
   attack ``tests/test_acceptance_oracle_green_means_something.py`` pins).
   This is a MISTAKE detector, not a sandbox: a spec-blind author has no
   reason to import app code at all when it must drive the app over HTTP, so
   catching it here turns "the author regressed to the old shape" into a
   retried authoring attempt rather than a silent hole.

2. :func:`run_oracle` — runs the (allowlisted) oracle file in a FACTORY-OWNED
   pytest invocation: its own temp cwd, its own (empty) ini, ``--rootdir``/
   ``--confcutdir``/``--noconftest`` pinned to that temp dir, a scrubbed
   environment with no ``PYTHONPATH``. None of the diff's ``conftest.py`` /
   ``pyproject.toml`` / ``tests/__init__.py`` attacks documented in the
   in-process module's history are reachable by pytest's OWN collection —
   none of those files are anywhere on this process's collection path.

⚠ WHAT THAT PARAGRAPH DOES **NOT** CLOSE (found 2026-08-07 by an adversarial
review, reproduced twice against this exact module). The oracle's tmpdir is a
same-user, same-machine, discoverable location: HEAD's production code is
BOOTED (imported) before the oracle ever runs, so it can run a background
thread that polls for a fresh ``factory-oracle-run-*`` directory and (a)
PLANTS a ``conftest.py`` there — ``--noconftest`` below closes exactly this —
or (b) OVERWRITES the oracle source file itself, keeping the same
``test_*`` function names so the junit node ids (and therefore the credited
set ``K``) survive untouched. Neither attack needs root, a shared filesystem,
or anything but the ordinary ability to list ``/tmp`` and open files the
current unix user owns — **the isolation boundary this module provides is
PROCESS, not PRIVILEGE**. Closing (b) needs a different mechanism than
"don't collect files you didn't ask for": it needs to know, AFTER the run,
that the file it asked pytest to grade is the file it is now reading the
verdict from. That is :func:`_tamper_check` — the load-bearing half of this
module, not a nice-to-have. A different uid (or a container) per boot is the
v1.1 closure that removes the same-user assumption entirely; until then this
module's own after-the-fact check is what makes a same-user attack SELF-
DEFEATING rather than merely inconvenient (see ``gates.acceptance_verified``'s
``oracle_run_tampered`` — never waivable, always authoritative).

The result carries a PER-CRITERION outcome map (junit-derived, keyed
``classname::name``) alongside the aggregate summary, because the
gutted-implementation control (AC2) grades criteria individually: a set with
one real assertion and nine tautologies must credit only the real one.
