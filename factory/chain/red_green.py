"""Harness-owned red→green verification (PLAN A.6) — one implementation.

Why this module exists
======================

A test the harness never ran at the BASE commit cannot tell you whether it is
able to fail. "Red-first" is *instructed* in ``factory/personas/dev.md`` and in
``factory/personas/acceptance_author.md``, and the chain then trusts the claim:
``PRContext.commit_history`` carries the dev's own ``tests_run_red`` report, and
nothing anywhere re-derives it. A gate whose green is produced by a test that
cannot fail is a gate detached from a real check, which
``factory/chain/gates/evaluator.py:18-29`` says is worse than no gate at all.

So the harness runs the test ITSELF at the merge base and observes the result.
Two consumers need exactly this, which is why it lives here and not inside one
of them:

* the ``acceptance-verified`` gate — the oracle must be RED at the merge base
  before its green at HEAD is credited (A.1c);
* a future gate over the DEV's new tests (A.6 proper) — same question, same
  states, same fallback.

⚠ THE CAVEAT — read this before tightening anything below
=========================================================

**Only the fails-at-base half of red→green is oracle-free.** Agentless measured
213/300 generated tests reproducing a bug but only 94/300 of those ALSO flipping
green under the gold patch, so a hard both-halves gate rejects good patches.
Two consequences are encoded in this module and must stay encoded:

1. "Fails at base" means **at least one test FAILED** at base
   (:func:`base_verdict`), never "the whole file was red". A story that
   implements one of its direction's several acceptance criteria produces an
   oracle whose other tests legitimately pass at base.

   An ERROR-only red is not "fails at base" — it is ``unknown``. An oracle that
   cannot be collected at the merge base (``from app.mod import thing`` for a
   module the story adds) is red no matter what it asserts, so a tautology rides
   that route to a credited green. See :func:`base_verdict` for the measurement.
   Errors and failures are different facts here, and only the second one is
   evidence.
2. When the base run cannot be TRUSTED — infra error, timeout, unreadable
   output, nothing collected, no merge base — the verdict is ``unknown``, and an
   ``unknown`` falls back to **regression-only selection: it must never be read
   as "approve"**. Callers get three states, ``red`` / ``green`` / ``unknown``,
   and only ``red`` licenses crediting a green at HEAD. ``unknown`` is a
   *skipped-with-reason*: not a pass, and not evidence against the dev either.

Tampering
=========

:func:`parse_pytest_summary` reads the LAST summary line in the output and flags
CONFLICTING summaries, because a dev-controlled ``conftest.py`` can print
``"7 passed in 0.01s"`` before pytest's own summary and a first-match parse
credits the forgery. Parsing alone cannot close that hole (a conftest can
implement ``pytest_report_teststatus`` and relabel skip→pass); the structural fix
is running in a throwaway :func:`judge_worktree` whose collection channels come
from the merge base, not from the dev's HEAD. Both layers are used together.

    ⚠ WHY AN ERRORS-ONLY RED IS ``unknown`` AND NOT ``red`` (2026-08-05)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    This function used to count ``errors`` as red alongside ``failed``, and that
    was a MEASURED forced pass. For a story that ADDS a module, an oracle whose
    only relationship to the criterion is ``from app.mod import thing`` raises
    ``ModuleNotFoundError`` at the merge base — a COLLECTION error — whatever it
    goes on to assert. So::

        from app.mod import normalize_email

        def test_ac1():
            assert True

    was red at base, green at HEAD, and credited ``verified=True,
    authoritative=True`` against an implementation that violated the criterion.
    The whole D1 family (``assert True``, a self-referential assertion, an
    assertion inside ``try/except``) rides that route, and it is the COMMON story
    shape rather than an exotic one: any story creating a new module reaches it
    whenever the app's test directory already exists at base, which it does for
    every app past its first commit.

    An error says the oracle could not RUN. Only a failure says its assertions
    ran and discriminated. Those are different facts and no parse of the base run
    alone can turn the first into the second — the file that failed to import is
    exactly the file whose assertions we are trying to evaluate.

    So an errors-only red is ``unknown``, which is not a block: it falls through
    to the ABLATION route, and ablation answers precisely the question the base
    run could not. The good case still merges — the real oracle for a new module
    goes red when its symbol is gutted — and the tautology does not, because
    gutting the code changes nothing ``assert True`` can see. The cost is that
    new-module stories take the (more expensive) ablation route rather than the
    cheap cached one; that is the price of the green meaning something.

    A mixed run (``1 failed, 1 error``) IS red: an assertion did run and did
    discriminate, and the caveat above forbids demanding that all of them do.

# pyproject.toml — a pytest ini source AND the dependency manifest
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# THE ONE FILE THE ROLLBACK MUST NOT REVERT WHOLESALE (2026-08-05)
#
# ``restore_paths_from`` reverts every path in the rollback set — the complement
# of ``is_production_path`` — to the merge base, and ``pyproject.toml`` is in that
# set because ``[tool.pytest.ini_options] addopts`` is a real forced-pass channel.
# But the same file is the DEPENDENCY MANIFEST, and an app's acceptance command
# resolves its environment from it: sacrifice runs
# ``uv run --extra dev pytest {test_file} -q`` with cwd ``backend``, and ``uv``
# reads exactly the file we reverted.
#
# MEASURED CONSEQUENCE: a story that adds a dependency, with a CORRECT
# implementation, produced ``passed=False, authoritative=True,
# reason="ran independent acceptance oracle exit_code=2"`` — the oracle died at
# collection on the dependency the story itself declares. ``authoritative`` means
# the gate blames the dev and re-dispatches with an identical failure signature, at
# $2+ per cycle, which is the non-convergence loop the gate's own comments warn
# about. The whole-file rollback INTRODUCED that: before it, the oracle ran in the
# dev's worktree where HEAD's dependencies were present.
#
# THE OPERATOR DECISION: separate the file's two roles. **Dependencies come from
# HEAD; pytest configuration comes from the merge base.** ``[project]``,
# ``[project.optional-dependencies]``, ``[tool.uv]``, ``[build-system]`` and every
# other table stay at HEAD; only ``[tool.pytest.*]`` is rolled back.
#
# ⚠ THE COST, STATED PLAINLY: the rollback set is no longer the clean complement
# of ``is_production_path``. ``pyproject.toml`` is a DOCUMENTED SPECIAL CASE, and
# that loss of uniformity is the price of the fix — a future reader widening either
# path classifier gets the rest of the set for free but must remember this file has
# its own handler.
#
# WHY NOT ``pytest -c <factory-owned ini>``, the more uniform-looking option.
# Measured 2026-08-05 against the real attack from the review: ``-c`` DOES fully
# neutralise the repo's ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` — ``addopts = "-p _fixup"``
# stops loading the plugin and the forced pass dies — and a conftest under the run
# cwd still loads. But an EMPTY factory-owned ini also discards
# ``asyncio_mode = "auto"``, and pytest then reports "async def functions are not
# natively supported" for every ``async def`` test. sacrifice is a FastAPI app whose
# shipped ``acceptance_harness_hint`` tells the dev-blind acceptance author that
# ``asyncio_mode = auto`` is set and ``async def`` tests need no decorator, so that
# is a false block on the app's normal oracle shape — the exact class of substrate
# mismatch that made this subsystem false-block 100% of stories the first time it
# ran. Filling the ``-c`` file from the merge base instead of leaving it empty does
# work (measured: ``mode=Mode.AUTO`` preserved, rootdir unchanged when the file sits
# beside the real one), but it buys the same semantics as the splice below for
# strictly more machinery: an ``env``/command channel threaded through
# ``evaluator._run_command`` AND ``mutation._run_suite`` so both routes get the
# flag, a dependence on the APP's pytest being new enough to accept ``-c`` with a
# ``.toml``, and a silent no-op for any app whose command is not a direct pytest
# invocation. The splice needs none of that and is verified against ``tomllib``
# before it is trusted.
#
# ⚠ WHAT TAKING DEPENDENCIES FROM HEAD NECESSARILY ADMITS. A dependency is code,
# and pytest auto-loads any installed distribution advertising a ``pytest11`` entry
# point. So ``dependencies = ["evil @ file:./tools/evil"]`` at HEAD is a forced-pass
# channel that no rollback of this file can close, and ``-c`` would not close it
# either (entry-point autoload does not read the ini). It is the same class as the
# in-process hole documented in ``gates/acceptance_verified``'s docstring and pinned
# by ``test_KNOWN_OPEN_production_code_can_patch_pytest_in_process``: dev-controlled
# code executing in the interpreter that computes the verdict. It is one more reason
# ``gates.acceptance_oracle`` stays OFF.
