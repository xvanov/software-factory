"""Operator story-resume: put a parked story back into the chain WITHOUT
rebuilding the work it already did.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Six terminal sinks in ``state_machine.StoryState`` document their own recovery
as "an operator moves the row back to a live dispatch state" —
``blocked_ci_unresolved``, ``blocked_dependency_unmet``,
``quarantined_invalid_state``, ``closed_by_operator``, ``blocked_underspecified``
and the pending-human blocks. **No command ever existed to do that.** The only
real recovery path an operator had was to close the story as superseded and
re-file the work as a brand-new story, which threw away every artifact the
story had already produced — its branch, its merged-quality diff, its dev
attempt history, its reviewer history, and the money already spent — and then
(before the same-day dependency-gate fix) deadlocked the replacement anyway.

That is the wrong shape for the failure this factory actually has. The common
wedge is not "the code is wrong". It is **the plumbing was wrong**: a leaked
docker network made the test gate permanently red on this host; a contract
specified a 401 body the app never produces, so an oracle authored from it could
never pass; an oracle graded a criterion the story was descoped out of. In every
one of those the dev's diff was correct and complete — 95% of the work was done
and paid for — and the only thing that needed to change was a gate, a spec, or
the host. Rebuilding the story from ``story_created`` re-runs the SM, re-runs
dev, re-runs the reviewer, and re-pays for all three to arrive back at the same
diff. Resuming re-runs only the part that was broken.

WHAT IT PRESERVES
-----------------
Everything that cost money or carries evidence: ``github_branch``,
``github_pr_number``, ``github_issue_number``, ``sm_result_json``,
``dev_attempts_json``, ``reviewer_history_json``, ``reviewer_result_json``,
``story_file_path``, and — critically — ``total_spend_usd``. The spend ledger is
the factory's cost truth; a resume is not permission to forget what a story
already cost, and zeroing it would make every audit and every budget breaker lie.

WHAT IT RESETS
--------------
Exactly the counters that would otherwise re-park the story on its first tick
back, and nothing else. This is the whole difficulty of the feature: a resume
that lands the story back in the same sink one tick later is not a resume, it is
a slower way to stay stuck (and it looks like a success in the operator's
terminal). See ``_RESET_NOTES`` for the itemised list and the reason for each.

WHAT IT REFUSES
---------------
A resume that provably cannot make progress is refused up-front rather than
performed and then silently undone by the next tick:

* the story is already ``deployed`` (nothing to resume);
* ``total_spend_usd`` is already at/over the per-story cap — the budget breaker
  would re-park it immediately, so the operator must raise the cap or pass
  ``--force`` and accept the overrun knowingly;
* resuming at the merge gates but the PR is closed and could not be reopened;
* the dependency gate would deadlock it again on the very next tick.

Refusing loudly beats "resumed!" followed by a silent re-park — that is the
``proxy != real`` failure class this repo keeps re-learning.

``--reauthor-oracle`` AND THE FREEZE
------------------------------------
The acceptance oracle is frozen before the dev starts, and that freeze is the
anti-reward-hack property — so deleting one to have it re-authored AFTER the
dev's code exists deserves the obvious objection. It does not weaken the
property, for the same reason ``acceptance.reauthor_missing_oracles`` may
already re-author on any later tick: the author is SPEC-ONLY
(``build_spec_prompt``), never sees the dev's diff, and writes into
``state/acceptance/`` outside the dev worktree. Independence is STRUCTURAL —
a function of what the author can read, not of when it runs. The gutted-
implementation control (``stub_runs.json``) is re-run against the new oracle
too, so a replacement that fails to discriminate is still caught.

What the flag actually buys is the case the freeze cannot handle on its own: the
SPEC was wrong. Direction 120's contract named a 401 body the app never
produces, so the frozen oracle asserted something no correct implementation
could satisfy, and the story was blocked for three evaluations by a defect in
the specification rather than in the code. Ratifying the contract changes what a
SPEC-ONLY author would write — but nothing re-authors a frozen oracle, so the
corrected spec could never reach the gate. Hence: explicit, operator-only,
audited in the ``story_resumed`` event, and never automatic.

    * event first, row-write fails  -> the story stays parked (visible, safe) and
      a stale reset sits on a row that no poller evaluates, because parked states

    * row first, event lost         -> the story is resumed with its window NOT
      reset, so the next evaluation re-parks it at the unchanged head sha — the
      exact bug this module exists to fix — while the operator reads a green
      "resumed" panel. A silent re-park wearing a success message.

    """Parked stories worth OFFERING to an operator as resumable.

    This is a SUGGESTION surface (``factory inbox``, ``factory why``), not a
    permission check: ``plan_resume`` deliberately does not consult it, so an
    operator who names a story explicitly can still resume anything that is not
    already ``deployed``. Filtering here shapes what the factory volunteers;
    filtering there would take away a recovery the operator may legitimately want.

    A genuinely BLOCKED row is ALWAYS offered: it is stuck by a failure, not by a
    decision, whatever the rest of its direction has managed. A row parked by a
    DECISION (``_NEEDS_LIVE_DIRECTION``) has to clear two further bars:

    * its direction has nothing deployed — once a sibling has landed, the work
      this row was abandoned in favour of is DONE, and resuming it would re-open
      settled history; and
    * it has BANKED WORK to preserve (:func:`has_banked_work`). This is the
      point of the whole feature, so it is the honest filter: a story with no PR,
      no dev attempt and $0 spent has nothing to recover, and re-triage is its
      correct path, not resume. On the live DB this is what separates ~10 real
      abandoned investments (a $6.25 story, a $4.31 story with an open PR) from
      ~50 never-started dual-draft alternates that only ever cost a DB row.
