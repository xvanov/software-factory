"""Operator-approval gate for machine-filed directions.

The treadmill this closes
-------------------------
A scheduled scanner persona (``security``, ``ux_auditor``) can file its own
work orders: every run it looks for
something to complain about, and it always finds something. On 2026-07-24 the
UX auditor filed D114/115/116 in ~2h (~$145 projected EOD spend); on
2026-07-30 it filed 015/016/017 — every one of them asking for *better inputs
for the auditor itself* — and ``auto_pm_sync`` triaged them into stories
WITHOUT an operator ever seeing them. Four PRs (#165/#166/#167/#169) had to be
closed by hand.

Throttling the schedule only slows the treadmill down; the structural fix is
that **a direction the factory filed for itself must not reach the build
pipeline until a human says yes.** This module is that predicate, and
``factory.chain.pm_sync`` (the single door from direction → stories) enforces
it.

Fail-safe by construction
-------------------------
The rule is an ALLOWLIST of sources that may auto-build, not a denylist of
scanner personas:

* human-filed (``operator*``, ``cli*``, ``user*``, ``human*``) → auto-builds,
  exactly as before. The human path is not slowed down at all.
* deterministic, externally-triggered detectors (``ci-health``,
  ``flake-quarantine``, ``github``/``github_issue`` intake of a *user-filed*
  issue) → auto-builds. These are not opinions: a required check went red, a
  test flaked, a person opened an issue.
* everything else — every ``scheduled-<persona>`` source, any future
  machine filer, **and any direction whose source cannot be determined**
  (missing/corrupt ``state.yaml``) → requires an explicit operator approval.

Approval is recorded in the direction's ``state.yaml`` under
``operator_approval`` (the same file that already carries ``source``,
``status`` and the ``audit`` trail), so it is human-readable, human-editable
and survives a restart. ``factory approve-direction`` is the supported way to
write it; ``factory inbox`` lists everything still waiting.
