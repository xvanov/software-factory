"""Hash-chained event streams: history becomes verifiable, not merely trusted.

``state/events/*.ndjson`` is the factory's memory of itself. It was append-only
best-effort with no sequence, linkage, or origin identity, so a truncated file, a
hand-edited line, and a row written by a different process were all
indistinguishable from real history. Two failures this addresses concretely:

* Test pollution — the suite and the live daemon wrote structurally identical
  rows, and synthetic failures were escalated by L1 as genuine ones for weeks.
* Self-edits — the factory rewrites its own code, and a verifier it can quietly
  weaken is not a verifier.

The tests below are organised as: the hash contract, then tamper detection, then
the benign conditions that must NOT be reported as tampering (this is the part
that decides whether the check survives contact with a real deployment).
