"""The benchmark RECORD store — ``bench/swebench/benchmark_store.py``.

The store exists because ``_sssf_adw_id`` and the run directory are both pure
functions of (instance, arm), so a re-run REUSES the id and DESTROYS the previous
attempt's artifacts: ``_reset_run_artifacts`` deletes the row's files and
``_work_dir(fresh=True)`` rmtree's the per-run ``data_dir`` holding the only
per-turn spend record. The engine's tracer db cannot fill the gap either — its
``sessions.total_cost`` is a running sum across attempts of the same cell.

So the value of this store is precisely the thing that is easy to break silently,
and each test here pins one such failure mode:

1. **idempotent re-ingest** — ingest is called automatically at the end of every
   sweep and by hand on old data; a second run must insert nothing. A store that
   double-counted would inflate every denominator computed from it;
2. **attempt history survives** — two attempts of the SAME (instance, arm), with
   the second having overwritten the first on disk, must be TWO rows. This is the
   whole reason the store exists, and it is one ``UNIQUE`` clause away from being
   silently wrong;
3. **invalid rows are classified, not counted** — a throttled row, a broken task,
   a grade-parse failure, a failed audit and a superseded arm key are each named
   and each excluded, and a budget cap hit is NOT excluded (pre-registered
   decision rule 4). Getting this wrong is exactly how the 2026-08-03 run was
   retracted;
4. **artifact hashes are recorded** — the trail has to be verifiable after the
   bytes are gone, and tampering has to be detectable;
5. **a replay record round-trips the roster exactly** — a replay that reproduces
   a DIFFERENT roster is worse than no replay, because it looks like one.

Everything here is $0: no model is called and no run is executed.

    not the same kind of thing:

    * ``idaholab__montepy-933_interface`` died of an unhandled ``AttributeError``
      inside the engine's stream reader. The planner never got to decide anything,
      so the arm was never asked the question — refused from numerator AND
      denominator, exactly like a throttled row.
    * ``keras-team__keras-22316`` was refused by ``permissions.enforce`` because the
      PLANNER wrote 18 paths outside its declared ``writes`` scope. That is the
      agent's own behaviour, and behaviour is what the arm is measured on — so it
      stays COUNTED, under its own reason.

    Every field of ``result.json`` a reader could have told them apart by was
    identical before this fix (``error: null``, ``termination: "terminal-state"``,
    ``adw_exit_code: 1``, ``steps_used: 2``), which is why the store has to ask the
    adapter rather than look at the message.
