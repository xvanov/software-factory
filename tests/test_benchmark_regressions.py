"""One test per HISTORICAL DEFECT of the swebench bench harness.

Every bug named here was found by running the thing, and every one of them
produced a NUMBER that looked publishable. That is what makes them worth a file of
their own: a crash announces itself, but a harness that reports \\$0.00 for a run
that spent \\$3.40, or 0% for a model that was never reached, hands you a table you
cannot tell apart from a real result. Four reports were retracted before this
file existed.

So this is not a unit-test file for a module. It is the ARTEFACT THAT STOPS THESE
RECURRING, and its rules are:

* one test per defect, named after the defect;
* each docstring states THE BUG, THE MEASURED EVIDENCE it was found by, and WHAT
  BREAKS IF THE GUARD GOES — because a regression test whose reason nobody can
  reconstruct gets deleted the first time it is inconvenient;
* where the guard already has a test elsewhere, this file asserts the GUARANTEE
  rather than duplicating the mechanism — but it must still FAIL if the guarantee
  is removed. Every test here was verified by breaking the underlying behaviour and
  watching it fail (see the commit that introduced it);
* no network, no model call, no docker, no money. Every fixture is planted.

The twelve:

  1. the ``developer`` role 422, swallowed as an empty response
  2. cost read from ``agent_end``, which is empty when a phase raises
  3. shared-db cost accumulating across attempts
  4. provider starvation counted as a capability failure
  5. diff pollution — scaffold paths in the graded diff, markdown over-excluded
  6. a "per-run" cost cap measured across runs, and the projection it zeroed
  7. a phase cap frozen at 18 while the engine's limits became configurable
  8. a resumed run's phases counted against the attempt that did not run them
  9. a plumbing abort counted in the capability denominator
 10. the base ref shadowed by the agent's own commits
 11. ``preflight`` reporting no credential problem while the model was unreachable
 12. prompt parity across all four sssf arms

    Too much: the obvious fix — exclude markdown — is worse. The documenter's
