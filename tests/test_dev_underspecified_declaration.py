"""The dev may declare a story underspecified instead of guessing.

EVIDENCE (ImpossibleBench, ICLR 2026, arXiv 2510.20270): offering the agent an
explicit way to declare a task impossible/underspecified dropped
test-exploitation from 54% -> 9% (GPT-5) and 49% -> 12% (o3). Under Loop-4 the
dev owns the tests that judge its own code, so "make the check agree with me"
is always in reach — which is precisely the false-green the 2026-08-04
hidden-oracle grading measured (chain self-verdict 40% precise).

The three properties that make the hatch usable are asserted here, because each
one silently dying would leave a prompt that promises something the chain does
not do: it is TERMINAL, it consumes NO dev retry, and it lands in front of a
human instead of in a retry loop.
