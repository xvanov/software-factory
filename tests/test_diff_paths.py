"""The ONE path classifier both the bench harness and the merge gate call.

Two matchers, one definition, opposite safe directions (see
``factory/diff_paths.py``): the bench STRIPS on the broad one, the merge gate
BLOCKS on the strict one. The invariant that keeps them from contradicting each
other — strict ⊆ broad — is asserted here, over this repo's own file list as
well as fixed cases.

The reason the split exists is measured, and it is pinned below: the broad
matcher calls ``factory/testing/flake.py`` a test file. That file is imported by
``factory/chain/gates/tests_green.py``. A REQUIRED merge gate using the broad
matcher would have refused to merge a story whose diff is confined to it — and
refused the ``factory_improver`` prompt_edit path outright, whose diffs are
persona ``.md`` files named ``test_*``.
