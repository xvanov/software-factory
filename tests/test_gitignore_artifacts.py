"""Direction 018 — machine-written projections are written to disk, never tracked.

These tests are deliberately written to be *falsifiable by reverting the change*.
The rules under test live in THIS repository's ``.gitignore``, so every test here
either reads that file or queries this repository's own git index. None of them
build a synthetic ``.gitignore`` string — a test that writes its own ignore rules
and then asserts git honours them tests git, not this repo (that was the defect in
the first attempt at this direction, PR #178: reverting ``.gitignore`` left all 15
of its tests green).

What is asserted:

* ``test_no_machine_written_projection_is_tracked`` — this repo's index holds zero
  paths matching the machine-written patterns (catches a re-added file, which
  ``.gitignore`` alone cannot: ignore rules never apply to tracked files).
* ``test_real_repo_status_is_free_of_machine_written_paths`` — this repo's own
  ``git status --porcelain`` for ``apps/`` and ``stories/`` names none of them.
* ``test_ignore_rules_*`` — this repo's ignore rules match the machine-written
  paths and do NOT match the human-authored siblings.
* ``test_transition_leaves_apps_clean`` — AC7. A real
  ``factory.directions.watcher.mark_direction_status`` transition, run against a
  scratch repository whose ``.gitignore`` is a *copy of this repository's real
  file*, leaves ``git status --porcelain -- apps/`` empty while still writing the
  projection to disk.
* ``test_transition_dirties_apps_without_the_ignore_rules`` — the mutation control
  for the above: strip the machine-written rules out of the copied real
  ``.gitignore`` and the same transition dirties the tree. This is what proves the
  clean assertion has teeth.

Why AC7 runs against a scratch root rather than this working tree: a real
transition writes an authoritative row to ``<root>/state/factory.db``, derived
from the direction's own directory path (``watcher._root_from_direction``), which
no fixture can redirect — pointing it at this repo would inject synthetic rows
into production telemetry, the exact test-pollution class this repo has already
been burned by. And asserting THIS tree is wholly clean would make the suite fail
whenever an operator has an uncommitted edit in ``apps/``. The index and status
assertions above cover this repository directly; this one covers the write path.
