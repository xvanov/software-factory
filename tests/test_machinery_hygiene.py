"""Step 3b — machinery hygiene. NO resolve yield is claimed for any of it.

Each fix names the sweep-2 row that cost something, and each is scoped so it
cannot change the live chain's behaviour where the live chain is already right.

1. **Slop detector base ref + scope.** Its candidate list was
   `("origin/main", "main", "HEAD~1")` — no `swebench-base`, which is the only
   correct base inside the benchmark. On `alibaba__opensandbox-816` it diffed from
   the wrong base, scored PRE-EXISTING UPSTREAM test files as slop, and clamped an
   explicit reviewer `approve` into a nonconvergence park: a $4, 17-minute rework
   cycle against the reviewer's judgement. The veto itself is documented
   fail-safe behaviour and is KEPT.

2. **`tests_green` with zero files changed.** It reads the return code and nothing
   else, so a dev that changed nothing reaches green whenever the suite already
   passed — `conan-io__conan-19750` declared green on an empty tree. Scoped to the
   bench driver by an explicit gate flag, because a docs-only, config-only or
   already-delivered story on the live chain legitimately changes no production
   file.

3. **Empty-diff short-circuit consults the retry budget.** It went terminal on the
   first empty diff with the budget untouched: `conan-19750` blocked with FOUR
   unused retries after Azure 429s truncated its analysis-only first turn.

4. **Containment: restore, don't just measure.** `test_readonly.bypassed_count >=
   1` on 33 of 38 chain rows. Grading strips test edits, so the graded PATCH was
   always clean — what was not clean is the CHAIN'S OWN GREEN. On
   `ucfopen__canvasapi-716` the dev rewrote an upstream negative test so its
   missing type check would pass, and the green was established against the
   weakened test.

5. **Pre-existing-failure baseline: NOT BUILT, on evidence.** Its only named
   beneficiary was `pandas-63945`, the sole row in the sweep with that shape (>=3
   red attempts, all red) — and the fresh control rules it a BROKEN instance, so
   `--only-working` excludes it. `selftest` + `--only-working` already IS the
   pre-existing-failure gate; the baseline only looked necessary because the
   control was nine days stale. Building a subtract-failures-and-call-it-green
   path with no beneficiary would add a way to declare a broken patch green.
