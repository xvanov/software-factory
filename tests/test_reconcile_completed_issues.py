"""Issue-lifecycle auto-close: dual-draft-aware direction completion + backfill.

Regression + feature coverage for the 2026-07-21 issue-lifecycle finding:

  * ``maybe_close_tracker_issue`` required EVERY child story to be ``DEPLOYED``,
    so a dual-draft direction (whose loser lands in ``SUPERSEDED_BY_SIBLING``)
    could NEVER close its tracker → trackers #54/#60/#77/#88 leaked open.
  * There was no way to reconcile issues left open for already-completed work
    (event-driven close on deploy can no-op on the async ``--auto`` path).
    ``reconcile_completed_issues`` is the idempotent, fail-safe backfill.
