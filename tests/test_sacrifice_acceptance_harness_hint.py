"""Regression guard for the auth route facts in sacrifice's acceptance hint.

``acceptance_harness_hint`` is the ONLY source of app-layout facts the
acceptance author gets: it is deliberately dev-blind (019 AC3 — the oracle runs
out of process and never imports the app tree), so it cannot check a route
against the code the way every other persona can. The hint also instructs it to
use the stated paths "never a guessed variant". A wrong fact here is therefore
not a hint that gets ignored — it is laundered into an authoritative-looking
oracle that 404s at HEAD no matter how correct the implementation is.

That happened: the hint named ``POST /api/auth/register`` and
``POST /api/auth/login``, and neither route has ever existed — the real ones
carry an ``/email`` segment. It stayed invisible because story 172, the only
story the live gate had graded, asserted ``/api/meta`` and never touched auth.

These assertions are about the CONFIG's claims, not about the sacrifice tree
(which is a sibling repo and is not present in CI), so this test is hermetic.
When sacrifice's auth routes genuinely change, update the hint and this test
together — that coupling is the point.

Workstream A1 (docs/BENCHMARK-READINESS-PLAN.md) extends this file with a
MECHANICAL cross-check, additive to the hand-verified assertions above, not a
replacement: every ``METHOD /path`` the hint names, and every required
request-body field it claims for a route, is checked against
``apps/sacrifice/derived/api_surface.json`` — a snapshot AST-parsed from the
real sacrifice tree by ``scripts/generate_sacrifice_api_surface.py`` (method,
path, and pydantic-required-field facts only; no boot, no DB, no import of
the app). That snapshot is checked in because CI never checks out sacrifice
(it lives only at ``/home/k/sacrifice`` on the operator's box) — so the
cross-check test below is hermetic like the rest of this file, and a SEPARATE
test, skipped when that local checkout is absent, re-derives the surface and
asserts the snapshot is not stale against it. Semantic facts the hint states
(plugin-type enums, error vocabulary, response bodies) are NOT covered here
on purpose: sacrifice's routes declare no ``responses=``, so those facts are
not mechanically derivable and stay hand-maintained prose. See A1 in the plan
before adding a semantic assertion here — it is out of scope by design, not
an oversight.

         A literal AFTER the arrow is a response body and is deliberately
         excluded by scoping the search to the pre-arrow text.
      2. A "REQUIRED fields" bullet with no route mention of its own (the
         goal-creation block): every bare backtick identifier in that bullet
