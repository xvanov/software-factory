"""A.1b — the chain's INDEPENDENT acceptance oracle, inside the measured arm.

The published ``factory`` 37% (and its 40% chain-verdict precision) were measured
with the chain's ONLY independent oracle ABSENT: ``run_factory`` seeds a story at
``SM_DONE`` and dispatches only ``dev``/``review``, i.e. it starts downstream of
``handle_stories_spawned``, where ``factory/chain/acceptance.py`` authors the
spec-only test. The arm labelled "the product" was not the whole product.

Every test here holds one of the properties that make authoring it in the
harness a measurement rather than a new leak:

1. the hidden GRADING oracle (``oracle.json.z``) can never reach the acceptance
   author, the dev or the reviewer — enforced by the author's signature;
2. the authored test is never visible to the dev — enforced against the real
   paths, not a comment;
3. the authored test can never reach the graded prediction diff;
4. every failure REFUSES the row rather than proceeding as if the oracle ran;

plus cost accounting (the authoring call must land in THIS run's ledger) and arm
parity (only the factory arm changes).
