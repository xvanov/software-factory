"""The ``solo-noreview`` arm — PLAN.md B.1 Phase 1a, the reviewer ablation.

Pre-registration: ``bench/swebench/PRE-REGISTRATION-B1.md``.

The arm exists to answer ONE question — does removing the reviewer round-trip
change the resolve rate — and it can only answer it if exactly one thing differs
from the ``factory`` arm. This harness has been retracted four times, twice
because two variables moved at once and neither was attributable, and once
specifically because two arms received DIFFERENT PROMPTS. So every test in this
file pins one of those failure modes shut, for $0:

1. **arm parity** — the two chain arms render a byte-identical task, proven
   structurally (the prompt expression has no arm-dependence at all), not by
   eyeballing two strings;
2. **single variable** — the two ``ArmSpec`` rows and the two driver modes differ
   only in the fields the ablation is allowed to move;
3. **the other five arms are untouched** — their registry rows are pinned by a
   hash of their exact tuples;
4. **fail loud** — a chain-driver arm with no mode entry is refused before any
   clone or any spend, rather than silently running the full chain and being
   published as an ablation;
5. **no artifact collision** — the new arm's run directory is its own, so it
   cannot destroy the ``factory`` arm's reviewer replay corpus.
