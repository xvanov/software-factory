"""The three sssf arms — ``gpt54-solo``, ``chain``, ``v32-solo``.

These arms do not drive ``factory/``. They drive a SEPARATE software factory at
``/home/k/sssf``, whose ``adws/adw_simple_sdlc.py`` runs a fixed phase graph over
a roster of named agents (planner, builder, reviewer, documenter). All three arms
run that ONE file with ONE graph and differ in exactly one thing: which model each
role is routed to.

This harness has been retracted four times, twice because two variables moved at
once and once specifically because two arms received DIFFERENT PROMPTS. So every
test here pins one of those failure modes shut, for $0:

1. **prompt parity** — the three arms render a byte-identical task, proven
   structurally (the arm id cannot reach the prompt expression at all), never by
   comparing two strings;
2. **one variable** — the three rosters differ only in models; ``thinking``, the
   tool lists, the ``writes`` fences, the test command and the phase graph are
   identical, and the three ``ArmSpec`` rows differ only in identity fields;
3. **the arm label is the truth** — three independent layers stop a row claiming a
   model set it did not run: a $0 pre-flight that the engine really implements
   ``skip_phases``, a roster that omits skipped roles so a regression dies at $0,
   and a post-run tripwire against the run's own trace;
4. **the spend guard is real** — the sssf engine enforces NO cost limit, so the
   harness's per-run dollar cap and its process-group kill are the only bound that
   exists, and it must not be defeated by a shared-database read losing a race;
5. **the published arms are untouched** — their registry rows are pinned by hash;
6. **the probe is genuinely free** — ``--probe-plumbing`` never invokes the engine,
   and its row always carries a recorded ``error`` so nothing can report it as a
   measurement.
